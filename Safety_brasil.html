<h1>A simple view of the aviation safety numbers in Brasil</h1>

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>This simple work came initially with my intention of praticing some more advanced Python plotting tecniques using matplotlib,seaborn and folium(some wide known Python libraries for data analysis) for a University of Michegan course at Coursera's platform. But i really enjoyed the results and made the decision to share my work. It's NOT  a scientific study and the results presented in here was just basic checked by me, so be really careful to use this data for any purpose because it may contains some errors. All the source code are avaliable in my GitHub. I'm totally opened to receive criticism,suggestions or praising </p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p> Is well known that aviation one of the most safer means of transport of the world. But, we frequentily see some acident at the news.So,it's difficult for the most part of the people to have a panorama of the general aviation safety numbers.Thinking about that, i used the Cenipa's dataset to build some interessing views of the  Brazilian aviation fatalities that occour in the last 10 years using Python.</p>
<p></p>

<h2>About the Dataset</h2>
<p>All data presented in here is based on the the Cenipa's "Aeronautical Occurrences in Brazilian Civil Aviation" dataset. CENIPA is a military organization, subordinated to the Brazilian Air Force, their principal role is prevent and investigate  the aviation accidents that happend in Brazilian territory.The dataset contains a lot of information of  all civil acidents and indents ocurried in Brasil for the last 10 years.It can be obtain by following <a href="http://www.dados.gov.br/dataset/ocorrencias-aeronauticas-da-aviacao-civil-brasileira">THIS LINK</a>. The image below shows  of how the information is organized in the diferent tables of the dataset. For my analysis i only considered the acidents that have at least one fatality.</p>

<h2> How many lifes we lost in Brazilian aviation in the last 10 years? and what are the most common caracteristics of thease acidents? </h2>
    <img src="Fatalities_year.png")>
    
<p>Obviously this question cannot be answered with only one graph, so let's start with the basics. The graph above shows us that we had in Brasil 823 fatalities due to aviation accidents. We can't observe a big difference in the numbers throughout the years. Of course, we can argue that 55 deaths in 2010 are much smaller than 110 deaths in 2011 but when we think in both numbers compared with the amount of people that use the air transport system during the year this quantity of deaths is really low and we can consider both numbers as being approximately the same.</p>

<p>Here comes the first really interesting view for the average passenger, aproximaly 70% of the acidents in the last 10 years occurred in private or experimental aviation. These types of flight are made by a minority and the regulation and inspection for this type of flight is much less strict when comparing to a regular comercial flight that we are used to taking. In fact, the 16 deaths in regular aviation happend in only one acident, a small airplane from a brand new regional carrier at the time called NOAR fall just after the takeoff in Recife - Pernambuco due to an Engine fail.The  company close up shortly after that. </p>

 <p>We already find out that private and experimental aviation is responsible for the major number of fatalities, let's look now for the principal events that led to a fatal crash. Before we begin, it's important to recognize one limitation of our dataset, there are too many categories with similar meaning  and some of them didn't even have a reasonable name. As you can see, there are a large number of fatalities in the category "indetermineted" it can be explained if we consider there are some on running investigations and sometimes find the main cause of an accident especially involving light planes can be really challenging or even impossible. As we can see,  loss of control in flight, engine fail and controlled flight with terrain are the three major events that led to an accident.</p>
<img src="Fatalities_phase.png")>
<p>Surprisinly the cruise phase is responsible for  25% of the fatalities. With almost the same percentage we have the takeoff who is the most critical part of the flight. it's curious that we didn't see the land phase in evidence here. i think in two main reasons for that. The first is related to our dataset and it's many categories, so what we expect is the land phase is actually divided into two or three different groups. The other reason is a guess and it's possibly wrong, i think if the pilot can manage to get to the land phase with airplane control it's more difficult to have a fatality because landing is a low energy phase of flight, so even if the crash happens it will be less destructive.  </p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>First of all, if you are a regular passenger like me, you probably are very happy with the findings of this little research into the Cenipa's dataset. First, we saw how the overall safety numbers of Brazilian aviation are good, in 10 years we had less than 1000 deaths. The COVID-19 can kill this amount in one day in the US! Another good fact is that only 16 people died in a commercial airplane so the regular commercial flights are responsible for less than 2% of fatalities occurred in 10 years. </p>
<p>Looking at the other types of flight like private, experimental and charter the numbers are bigger but still good. To be honest, i saw these data with optimism and i will explain why. A great part of the accidents can be prevented by doing some basic things like respecting the regulations, air traffic rules, and maintenance schedules.in US or Europe, aircrafts equipped with Instruments that help the pilot to avoid some critical situations are the rule . with the modernization of our private fleet, accidents caused by these situations, like controlled flight into terrain(CFIT), will become rarer in Brasil.</p> 
<h2>Exploring the dataset with Folium</h2>
<p>I ploted all the ocourrencies of this work in a map using the city and state name  provided by Cenipa(i didn't use the latitude and longitude because it not have a common standard in the dataset). Here, you can explore the acidents using interactivity and discover how they are spread in the country territory! Feel free to click on the markers and find out more details of the event(In portuguese,sorry i can't translate all the dataset)</p>
